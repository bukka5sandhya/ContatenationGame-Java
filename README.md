Your task is to help Sameer by combining the N lines of space-separated strings vertically (columnwise).

Write a program that reads an integer N and the N lines of space-separated strings and prints the resultant strings.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer representing N .

The next N lines of the input contain space-separated strings.

Output

The output should be a line-seperated strings obtained by combining the N lines of space-separated strings vertically (column-wise).

Explanation

For example,

I solve
can this

Combine the first word of the first line I with the first word of the second line can  Ican.

Combine the second word of the first line solve with the second word of the second line this solvethis.

the ouput is 

Ican
solvethis

If the given N  2 , and each line contains of space-separated strings as follows:
For example,
by by
hy hy

The output should be,
byhy
byhy

Combine the first word of the first line by with the first word of the second line hy  byhy.
Combine the second word of the first line by with the second word of the second line hy  byhy
